### ***I'm Pablo and I'm in the process of becoming a Junior web application developer, I'm from Malaga, Andalucia, Spain.***

I really like technology and I've worked as a computer technician for 5 years, I also worked as a graphic designer and I studied web design
so maybe what most calls me is the frontEnd, but I want to leave a gap to the backEnd and get into this world.

During my computer days, my job entailed the assembly/modification of high performance gaming computers, on [Versus gamers](https://www.vsgamers.es).
